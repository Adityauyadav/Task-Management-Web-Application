# Task Manager

This is a simple **Task Manager** application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. It was originally built using **PHP** with a MySQL database but has been converted to a **plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS** version that works with localStorage.

## Running the PHP Version

### Prerequisites:
- Install **XAMPP** (or any PHP server) to run PHP files.
- Create a MySQL database named `Task`.
- Create a table named `task_list` with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE task_list (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    task_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```
```

### Steps to Run:
1. Start **Apache** and **MySQL** in XAMPP.
2. Copy the PHP files (`add_task.php`, `delete_task.php`, `display_tasks.php`, `edit_task.php`, and `task_management.php`) into the XAMPP `htdocs` folder.
3. Open `http://localhost/task_management.php` in your browser.
4. Use the form to add, edit, and delete tasks.

## Running the HTML & JavaScript Version

### Steps:
1. Open `index.html` (the JavaScript version of the task manager) in any modern web browser.
2. Tasks will be stored in `localStorage`, so no backend or database is needed.
3. Use the interface to add, edit, and delete tasks.

## Differences Between Versions

| Feature            | PHP + MySQL Version | HTML + JS Version |
|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Storage           | MySQL Database      | localStorage    |
| Backend Required | Yes (PHP)           | No (Client-side only) |
| Server Setup      | Needed (XAMPP)      | No setup required |

You can choose which version suits your needs. The **PHP version** is useful for real-world applications with databases, while the **HTML & JS version** is lightweight and runs entirely in the browser.
